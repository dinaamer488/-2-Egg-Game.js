# Egg‑Game.js

## Description

Egg‑Game is a simple game template/project intended for building a small interactive game. It provides basic structure, assets and logic so you can customize, expand, or use it as a learning base for game development.

## What It Does / Features

- Basic game logic and structure  
- Simple user interface (HTML/CSS/JS or framework-based)  
- Easy to understand and modify — suitable for learning or small projects  
- Placeholder for assets (images, sounds, fonts) if needed  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/dinaamer488/Eggs-Game.git
Open the main file (e.g. index.html, or the entry file if using a framework) in your browser or run the project as per framework instructions.

Explore the code, learn how the game works, and feel free to customize assets, logic, or UI.

Possible Use Cases

As a learning project to practice HTML / CSS / JS (or chosen framework)
